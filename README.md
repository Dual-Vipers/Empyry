Empyry is a manager-agnostic package repository that supports private and public repositories, or both at the same time (public and private packages). Empyry is built around a simple plugin API, allowing for any package manager to be supported via a downloaded plugin.

## Why Empyry?

As programming languages continue to become more specialized, individuals and companies are using a wider range of different package managers, and therefore different registries. Each registry requires a different login for each user, and has its own bill.
Empyry replaces all of these registries, centralizing your private and public dependencies across all your languages in one place, with one simple user system, on your own hosted system.
